<h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on</p>

    <p>Stacy, can I come over after school?<br/>
(After school)<br/>
We can hang around by the pool<br/>
(Hang by the pool)<br/>
Did your mom get back from her business trip?<br/>
(Business trip)<br/>
Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip?<br/>
(Give me the slip)</p>

<p>You know, I'm not the little boy that I used to be<br/>
I'm all grown up now<br/>
Baby, can't you see?
</p>

<p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
She's all I want<br/>
And I've waited for so long<br/>
Stacy, can't you see?<br/>
You're just not the girl for <br/>
I know it might be wrong but<br/>
I'm in love with Stacy's mom</p>

<p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
</p>

<p>Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn?<br/>
(Mowed your lawn)<br/>
Your mom came out with just a towel on<br/>
(Towel on)<br>
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared<br>
(The way she stared)<br>
And the way she said<br>
"You missed a spot over there"<br>
(A spot over there)</p>

<p>And I know that you think it's just a fantasy<br>
But since your dad walked out<br>
Your mom could use a guy like me</p>

<p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br>
She's all I want<br>
And I've waited for so long<br>
Stacy, can't you see?<br>
You're just not the girl for me <br>
I know it might be wrong but <br>
I'm in love with Stacy's mom</p>

<p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on <br>
 (she's got it going on) <br>
She's all I want and I've waited for so long <br>
(waited and waited) <br>
Stacy, can't you see?<br>
You're just not the girl for me <br>
I know it might be wrong <br>
I'm in love with</p>

<p>Stacy's mom, oh, oh <br>
(I'm in love with) <br>
Stacy's mom, oh, oh <br>
(Wait a minute) <br>
Stacy, can't you see? <br>
You're just not the girl for me <br>
I know it might be wrong but <br>
I'm in love with Stacy's mom</p>

<h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>Hey, don't write yourself off yet <br>
It's only in your head, you feel left out <br>
Or looked down on <br>
Just try your best <br>
Try everything you can <br>
And don't you worry what they tell themselves <br>
When you're away</p>

<p>It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright, alright</p>

<p>Hey, you know they're all the same <br>
You know you're doing better on your own (on your own)<br>
So don't buy in <br>
Live right now <br>
Yeah, just be yourself <br>
It doesn't matter if it's good enough (good enough) <br>
For someone else</p>

<p>It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright, alright <br>
It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright, alright</p>

<p>Whoo!</p>

<p>Hey, don't write yourself off yet <br>
It's only in your head, you feel left out (feel left out) <br>
Or looked down on <br>
Just do your best (just do your best) <br>
Do everything you can (do everything you can) <br>
And don't you worry what their bitter hearts (bitter hearts) <br>
Are gonna say</p>

<p>It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright, alright <br>
It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright</p>

    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>There's a place off Ocean Avenue <br>
Where I used to sit and talk with you <br>
We were both 16 and it felt so right <br>
Sleeping all day, staying up all night <br>
Staying up all night</p>

<p>There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street <br>
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet <br>
We were both 18 and it felt so right <br>
Sleeping all day, staying up all night <br>
Staying up all night</p>

<p>If I could find you now things would get better <br>
We could leave this town and run forever <br>
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away</p>

<p>There's a piece of you that's here with me <br>
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see <br>
When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by <br>
I can make believe that you're here tonight <br>
That you're here tonight</p>

<p>If I could find you now things would get better <br>
We could leave this town and run forever <br>
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together <br>
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away</p>

<p>I remember the look in your eyes <br>
When I told you that this was goodbye <br>
You were begging me not tonight <br>
Not here, not now <br>
We're looking up at the same night sky <br>
And keep pretending the sun will not rise <br>
Be together for one more night <br>
Somewhere, somehow</p>

<p>If I could find you now things would get better <br>
We could leave this town and run forever <br>
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together <br>
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away</p>

    <p>[Tom DeLonge:] <br>
All the small things <br>
True care, truth brings <br>
I'll take one lift <br>
Your ride, best trip <br>
Always, I know <br>
You'll be at my show <br>
Watching, waiting <br>
Commiserating</p>

<p>Say it ain't so, I will not go <br>
Turn the lights off, carry me home</p>

<p>
[Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus:] <br>
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <br>
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <br>
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <br>
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na</p>

<p>[Tom DeLonge:] <br>
Late night, come home <br>
Work sucks, I know <br>
She left me roses by the stairs <br>
Surprises let me know she cares</p>

<p>Just say it ain't so, I will not go <br>
Turn the lights off, carry me home</p>

Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <br>

<p>Say it ain't so, I will not go <br>
Turn the lights off, carry me home <br>
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill <br>
The night will go on, my little windmill</p>

Say it ain't so, I will not go <br>

    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>What's with these homies dissin' my girl? <br>
Why do they gotta front? <br>
What did we ever do to these guys <br>
That made them so violent?</p>

<p>Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours <br>
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine <br>
Woo-hoo, that's for all the time</p>

<p>I look just like Buddy Holly <br>
And you're Mary Tyler Moore <br>
I don't care what they say about us anyway <br>
I don't care 'bout that</p>

<p>Don't you ever fear, I'm always near <br>
I know that you need help <br>
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit <br>
You need a guardian</p>

<p>Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours <br>
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine <br>
Woo-hoo, that's for all the time</p>

<p>I look just like Buddy Holly <br>
And you're Mary Tyler Moore <br>
I don't care what they say about us anyway <br>
I don't care 'bout that <br>
I don't care 'bout that</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Knock on the door <br>
Another big bang, get down on the floor <br>
Oh no! What do we do? <br>
Don't look now but I lost my shoe <br>
I can't run and I can't kick <br>
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' sick? <br>
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?<br>
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' blue? Oh-oh!</p>

<p>That's for all the time <br>
That's for all the time</p>

I don't care what they say about us anyway <br>

    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>What, what would you say <br>
If you could say <br>
Everything you needed to <br>
To the one you needed to? <br>
You flash like a setting sun <br>
You come around, I come undone <br>
Can't find the sound under my tongue when I look at you</p>

<p>I lose my voice when I look at you <br>
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <br>
Tell you all the right words <br>
Waiting on the right words <br>
Just another lovesick afternoon <br>
Black butterflies and déjà vu <br>
Hoping for the right words <br>
Waiting for the right words</p>

<p>Just yesterday north of LA <br>
I couldn't help but think of you <br>
Every time I think of you <br>
You crash like a rolling wave <br>
You come around I lose my brain <br>
Can't find the sound under my tongue when I look at you</p>

<p>I lose my voice when I look at you <br>
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <br>
Tell you all the right words <br>
Waiting on the right words <br>
Just another lovesick afternoon <br>
Black butterflies and déjà vu <br>
Hoping for the right words <br>
Waiting for the right words</p>

<p>'ve been searching for the right words, right words <br>
But I, I can't even find a an echo <br>
Don't you let go <br>
There are only twenty six letters I can use <br>
Just to tell you I won't let go <br>
Don't you let go</p>

<p>I lose my voice when I look at you <br>
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <br>
Tell you all the right words <br>
Waiting on the right words <br>
Just another lovesick afternoon <br>
Black butterflies and déjà vu <br>
Hoping for the right words <br>
Waiting for the right words</p>

<p>I lose my voice when I look at you <br>
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <br>
Tell you all the right words <br>
Waiting on the right words <br>
Just another lovesick afternoon <br>
Black butterflies and déjà vu <br>
Hoping for the right words <br>

    <p>Eighteen, crazy <br>
pulled up in your daddy's car <br>
you wanna move in with me <br>
guess we're off to a heavy start</p>

<p>Should've seen this coming from a mile away <br>
eighteen, crazy <br>
I know what you want from me <br>
I know what you want from me</p>

<p>So if you wanna piss off your parents <br>
date me to scare them <br>
show them you're all grown up <br>
If long hair and tattoos are what attract you <br>
baby then you're in luck <br>
and I know it's just a phase <br>
you're not in love with me <br>
you wanna piss off your parents, baby <br>
piss off your parents <br>
that's alright with me</p>

<p>You know I'm broke <br>
so you pulled out your daddy's card <br>
I drink, I smoke <br>
you ate it up from the very start</p>

<p>Should've seen this coming from a mile away <br>
I'll play your game <br>
I know what you want from me <br>
I know what you want from me</p>

<p>So if you wanna piss off your parents <br>
date me to scare them <br>

    <p>Don't wanna be an American idiot! <br>
Don't want a nation under the new media <br>
And can you hear the sound of hysteria? <br>
The subliminal mind fuck America! <br>
Alright!</p>

<p>Welcome to a new kind of tension <br>
All across the alien nation <br>
Where everything isn't meant to be okay <br>
Television dreams of tomorrow <br>
We're not the ones who're meant to follow <br>
For that's enough to argue!</p>

<p>Well, maybe I'm the f***** America <br>
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda(alright!) <br>
Now everybody do the propaganda <br>
And sing along to the age of paranoia  <br>
Alright!</p>

<p>Welcome to a new kind of tension <br>
All across the alienation <br>
Where everything isn't meant to be okay <br>
Television dreams of tomorrow <br>
We're not the ones who're meant to follow <br>
For that's enough to argue</p>

<p>Don't want to be an American idiot <br>
One nation controlled by the media <br>
Information age of hysteria <br>
It's calling out to idiot America</p>

<p>Welcome to a new kind of tension <br>
All across the alienation <br>
Where everything isn't meant to be okay <br>
Television dreams of tomorrow <br>
We're not the ones who're meant to follow <br>
