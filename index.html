<h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on</p>

    <p>Stacy, can I come over after school?<br/>
(After school)<br/>
We can hang around by the pool<br/>
(Hang by the pool)<br/>
Did your mom get back from her business trip?<br/>
(Business trip)<br/>
Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip?<br/>
(Give me the slip)</p>

<p>You know, I'm not the little boy that I used to be<br/>
I'm all grown up now<br/>
Baby, can't you see?
</p>

<p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
She's all I want<br/>
And I've waited for so long<br/>
Stacy, can't you see?<br/>
You're just not the girl for <br/>
I know it might be wrong but<br/>
I'm in love with Stacy's mom</p>

<p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br/>
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
</p>

<p>Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn?<br/>
(Mowed your lawn)<br/>
Your mom came out with just a towel on<br/>
(Towel on)<br>
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared<br>
(The way she stared)<br>
And the way she said<br>
"You missed a spot over there"<br>
(A spot over there)</p>

<p>And I know that you think it's just a fantasy<br>
But since your dad walked out<br>
Your mom could use a guy like me</p>

<p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on<br>
She's all I want<br>
And I've waited for so long<br>
Stacy, can't you see?<br>
You're just not the girl for me <br>
I know it might be wrong but <br>
I'm in love with Stacy's mom</p>

<p>Stacy's mom has got it goin' on <br>
 (she's got it going on) <br>
She's all I want and I've waited for so long <br>
(waited and waited) <br>
Stacy, can't you see?<br>
You're just not the girl for me <br>
I know it might be wrong <br>
I'm in love with</p>

<p>Stacy's mom, oh, oh <br>
(I'm in love with) <br>
Stacy's mom, oh, oh <br>
(Wait a minute) <br>
Stacy, can't you see? <br>
You're just not the girl for me <br>
I know it might be wrong but <br>
I'm in love with Stacy's mom</p>

<h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>Hey, don't write yourself off yet <br>
It's only in your head, you feel left out <br>
Or looked down on <br>
Just try your best <br>
Try everything you can <br>
And don't you worry what they tell themselves <br>
When you're away</p>

<p>It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright, alright</p>

<p>Hey, you know they're all the same <br>
You know you're doing better on your own (on your own)<br>
So don't buy in <br>
Live right now <br>
Yeah, just be yourself <br>
It doesn't matter if it's good enough (good enough) <br>
For someone else</p>

<p>It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright, alright <br>
It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright, alright</p>

<p>Whoo!</p>

<p>Hey, don't write yourself off yet <br>
It's only in your head, you feel left out (feel left out) <br>
Or looked down on <br>
Just do your best (just do your best) <br>
Do everything you can (do everything you can) <br>
And don't you worry what their bitter hearts (bitter hearts) <br>
Are gonna say</p>

<p>It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright, alright <br>
It just takes some time <br>
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride <br>
Everything, everything'll be just fine <br>
Everything, everything'll be alright</p>

    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>All that I want <br>
Is to wake up fine <br>
Tell me that I'm alright <br>
That I ain't gonna die <br>
All that I want <br>
Is a hole in the ground <br>
You can tell me when it's alright <br>
For me to come out</p>

<p>gonna make you wonder why you even try <br>
(Hard times) gonna take you down and laugh when you cry <br>
(These lives) and I still don't know how I even survive <br>
(Hard times) <br>
(Hard times) <br>
And I gotta get to rock bottom</p>

<p>Walking around <br>
With my little rain cloud <br>
Hanging over my head <br>
And it ain't coming down <br>
Where do I go? <br>
Gimme some sort of sign <br>
You hit me with lightning <br>
Maybe I'll come alive</p>

<p>gonna make you wonder why you even try <br>
(Hard times) gonna take you down and laugh when you cry <br>
(These lives) and I still don't know how I even survive <br>
(Hard times) <br>
(Hard times) <br>
And I gotta hit rock bottom</p>

<p>Tell my friends I'm coming down <br>
We'll kick it when I hit the ground <br>
Tell my friends I'm coming down <br>
We'll kick it when I hit the ground <br>
When I hit the ground <br>
When I hit the ground <br>
When I hit the ground <br>
When I hit the ground</p>

<p>gonna make you wonder why you even try <br>
(Hard times) gonna take you down and laugh when you cry <br>
(These lives) and I still don't know how I even survive <br>
(Hard times) (hard times) <br>
(Hard times) (hard times)</p>

<p>gonna make you wonder why you even try <br>

    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p> I remember the first night that she said <br>
"Oh, maybe I can't do this on my own." <br>
And despite all the reassurances and reoccurrences, you will not be alone <br>
And I know that you're holding out for better weather <br>
And I can't promise you that I'll be round forever <br>
If there's one thing I know it's that we're good together <br>
(If there's one thing I know it's that we're good together)</p>

<p>And I will try to hold you up through those times when you are gone <br>
Despite the weather, it gets better <br>
You won't do this alone (do this alone)</p>

<p>I remember the first night that she went <br>
To find her little place inside this world <br>
I won't forget the way she broke her tape down <br>
She needed it now <br>
She ran into it all</p>

<p>And I know that you're holding out for better weather <br>
And I can't promise you that I'll be round forever <br>
If there's one thing I know it's that we're good together <br>
(If there's one thing I know it's that we're good together)</p>

<p>And I will try to hold you up through those times when you are gone <br>
Despite the weather, it gets better <br>
You won't do this alone</p>
